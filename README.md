# Market-Value-of-American-Homes-AHS-
An analysis of the market value of American Homes using the American Housing Survey Public Use File.

In order to run this regression, the data must be imported into the python script. The dataframe is too large to upload to gitHub. The data used is the 2019 American Housing Survey Public Use File. This data was imported into Stata format, and then split into two groups, one below age 65, and one above, to allow for it to be imported into python with limited RAM, as well as for more clarity in the definitions of variables in Stata format. If you are interested in running the regression through my code, feel free to email me at chaseluey@gmail.com and ask for the Stata formatted files.
